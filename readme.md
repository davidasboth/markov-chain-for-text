#### Markov Chain for Text

An implementation of second-order Markov Chains for text generation.

For usage, see example file, markov-example.py which shows the two ways to train the Markov Chain:
* with a single string as the training set
* or a list of filenames

Example text files are also included.

* lyrics.txt includes the lyrics to most Muse songs (from [AZ Lyrics](www.azlyrics.com))
* standup.txt includes the text from a [Robin Williams stand-up routine](http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/r/robin-williams-live-on-broadway-script.html)

Happy text generating!
