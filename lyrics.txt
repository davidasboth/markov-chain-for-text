Come waste your millions here
Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow
She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons make no mistake
Come let the truth be shared
No-one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cries
She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons make no mistake
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll burn forever
I can't face the shame
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll burn forever
I can't face the shame
 
She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time so
Look the other way
You will wait until it's over
To reveal what you'd never shown her
Too little much too late
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world
Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own
I have played in every toilet
But you still want to spoil it
To prove I've made a big mistake
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world
Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own
I'll do it on my own
 
It's happening soon
It's happening soon
It's scent has been blowing in my direction
To me it is new
To me it is new
And it's not gonna change for anybody
And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you
It's got to be here
It's got to be there
It's got to be now
Or I'll lose forever
To me it is strange
This feeling is strange
But it's not gonna change for anybody
And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you
Accuse me
Trust me
I never knew
That you were the one
You were the one
Oh
And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you
And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you
 
I'm falling down
And fifteen thousand people scream
They were all begging for your dream
I'm falling down
Five thousand houses burning down
No-one is gonna save this town
Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't here
No it wasn't here
I was calling your name
But you would never hear me sing
You wouldn't let me begin
So I'm crawling away
'Cause you broke my heart in two
No, I will not forget you
Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you
Noooooo
Falling away
You would never see me through
No, I could not forget you
Falling down
Five thousand house burning down
No-one is gonna save this town
Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you
No
Falling down
Now the world is upside down
I'm heading straight for the clouds
 
Leave me alone it's nothing serious
I'll do it myself
It's got nothing to do with you
And there's nothing that you could do
You can see it and you can almost hear it too
You can almost taste it
It's nothing to do with you
And it's still nothing that you can do
So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
I'll burn your heart away
Please close your ears
And try to look away
So you never hear a single word I say
And don't ever come my way
Leave me alone
It's nothing serious
I'll do it myself
It's got nothing to do with you
And there's still nothing that you could do
So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
And arrest me for my mistakes
 
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
Pushing us into self destruction
Pushing us into self destruction
And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
Trying to please you for too long
Trying to please you for too long
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self destruction
And pushing us into self destruction
And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
 
You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You could be the one I'll always love
You could be the one who listens to my deepest inquisitions
You could be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken pieces of the life I had before
First there was the one who challenged
All my dreams and all my balance
She could never be as good as you
You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You should be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken pieces of the life I had before
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken pieces of the life I had before
Before you
 
This means nothing to me
'Cause you are nothing to me
And it means nothing to me
That you blew this away
'Cause you could have been number one
If you only found the time
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you had the chance
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
You're still nothing to me
And this is nothing to me
And you don't know what you've done
But I'll give you a clue
You could have been number one
If you only had the chance
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you had the time
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
 
Royal Canadian blended
The spicy aroma had mended me
Matured for years and imported
Into my glass you poured it
And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me
You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me
The wild turkey's been chosen
Its caramel nose could smell me
Arbourler/Jameson I love you
The single malts came burning
And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me
You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me
Royal Canadian Blended
The spicy aroma had mended me
And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me
You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me
 
You would say anything
You would try anything
To escape your meaningless
And your insignificance
You're uncontrolable
And we are unloveable
And I don't want you to think that I care
I never would
I never could
Again
Why can't you just love her?
Why be such a monster?
You bully from a distance
Your brain needs some assistance
But I'll still take all the blame
'Cause you and me are both one and the same
And it's driving me mad
And it's driving me mad
I'll take back all the things that I said
I didn't realise I was always talking to the living dead
And I don't want you to think that I care
I never would
I never could
Again
You would say anything
You would try anything
To escape your meaningless
And your insignificance
 
You needed it when I was away
And no matter what I say
Your'll never forget when I wasn't there so
Why should I care?
I'm young but I know that I'm aroused
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
It doesn't matter where I have gone
I just can't afford to
Pay for all the mistakes that you have made
It's about time I was paid
I'm young but I know that I'm aroused
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
 
Oh I am growing tired
Of allowing you to steal
Everything I have
You're making me feel
Like I was born to service you
But I am growing by the hour
You left us far behind
So we all discard our souls
And blaze through your skies
So unafraid to die
'Cause I was born to destroy you
And I am growing by the hour
And I'm getting strong in every way
Yeah, Yeah
You led me on
You led me on
You
Oh, and I'm getting strong in every way
Yeah, Yeah
 
Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
The bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Hopeless time to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are you worth
You can't come down to earth
You're swelling up, you're unstoppable
'cause you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'cause I'm drifting away
Away from you
Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like it's a birth squeeze
And the love for what you hide
And the bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting their last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'cause I'm drifting away
Away from you
 
Everything about you is how I'd wanna be
Your freedom comes naturally
Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less
Give me
All the peace and joy in your mind
Everything about you pains my envying
Your soul can't hate anything
Everything about you is so easy to love
They're watching you from above
Give me
All the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Give me the peace and joy in your mind
Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less
Give me
All the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Give me the peace and joy in your mind
 
mmmmm,
H8 is the one for me
It gives me all I need
and helps me co-exist
With the chill
You make me sick
Because I adore you so
I love all the dirty tricks
And twisted games you play
On me
Space dementia in your eyes and
Peace will arise
And tear us apart
And make us meaningless again
Mmmm, yeah
You'll make us wanna die
I'd cut your name in my heart
Will destroy this world for you
I know you want me to
Feel your pain
Space dementia in your eyes and
Peace will arise
And tear us apart
And make us meaningless again
Ooooh ...
 
Your golden lies feed my role
In this forgotten space race under my control
Who's returned from the dead?
Who remains?
You know I don't want you 
and I never did
I don't want you 
and I never will
You wanted more than I was worth
And you think I was scared
And you needed proof
Who really cares anymore?
Who restrains?
You know I don't love you 
and I never did
I don't want you 
and I never will
 
I've exposed your lies, baby 
The underneath is no big surprise 
Now it's time for changing 
And cleansing everything 
To forget your love
My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
Is tired of living
Don't confuse 
Baby you're gonna lose 
Your own game 
Change me 
Replace the envying 
To forget your love
My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
I'm tired of living
And I've seen your loving 
But mine is gone 
And I've been in trouble
 
Break me in, 
Teach us to cheat
And to lie, cover up
What shouldn't be shared?
All the truth unwinding
Scraping away 
At my mind
Please stop asking me to describe him
For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free
Self expressed, exhausting for all
To see and to be
What you want and what you need
The truth unwinding
Scraping away 
At my mind
Please stop asking me to describe
For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free
For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free
Wash me away
Clean your body of me
Erase all the memories
They will only bring us pain
And I've seen all I'll ever need
 
Hands are red with your blame
Megaphone screaming my name
Whimpers someone I should've loved
Souls weeping above
I've seen what you're doing to me
Destroying puppet strings
To our souls
Micro waves me insane
A blade cuts in your brain
Sounds like forks on a plate
Blackboard scratched with hate
I've seen what you're doing to me
Destroying puppet strings
To our souls
 
Who's so phoney and always surrounded?
Stop your screaming, no one can hear
All the scars on your skin: "Post no bills"
Who you were
Was so beautiful
Remember who, who you were
Hide from the mirror, the cracks and the memories
Hide from your family, they won't know you now
For all the holes in our soul host no thrills
Who you were
Was so beautiful
Memories who, who you were
 
Passing by you light up my darkest skies
You take only seconds to draw me in
So be mine and your innocence I will consume
Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
Because it's good
Hold your hands up to your eyes again
Hide from the scary scenes, suppress your fears
So be mine and your innocence I will consume
Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
Because it's good
You're dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
Because it's good
Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
Because it's good
 
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Reeds driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom in the trees
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies are all havin' fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me
Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Yeah, freedom is mine
And you know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
Oh
Freeer than you
Oh
Feeling good
 
Paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for?
Could someone tell me please?
The good news is, she can't have babies
And wont accept gifts from me
What are they for?
They'll just grow up, and break the laws you've loved
Take off your disguise
I know that underneath
It's me
Useless device, it won't suffice
I want a new game to play
When I am gone
It won't be long, before I disturb you in the dark
And paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for?
Will someone tell me please?
Take off your disguise
I know that underneath
It's me
 
Ignorance pulls
Apostasy and apathy still rules
Yeah you know it's cool
Just suck and see
A future turns us into silent gods
And I won't miss you at all
Grounded
Boxed in
Like the evil in your veins
Grounded
Boxed in
I am stuck with you
Fate can't decide
Alignment of the planets in your hands
Come on crush our plans
Just suck and see
A future that won't let you disagree
And I won't miss you at all
Grounded
Boxed in
Like the evil in your veins
Grounded
Boxed in
I am stuck with you
Feel it, hear it
Right apathy you are
See it, be it
You'll see
 
Push me in
Into there
Force me in
Into there
Screaming
Into there
Push me in
Into there
WIth force
Into there
Into there
Into there
 
Cast your eye tears on to me
And I'll show you what you really need
Give too much attention
And I'll reflect your imperfections
Can't you see it's over?
Because you're the god of a shrinking universe
Purposeless survival
Now there's nothing left to die for
So don't struggle to recognise
Now they call it "Heart-felt suicide"
Can't you see it's over?
Because you're the god of a shrinking universe
[Matt Bellamy's falsetto ooooooooooooooooooooooooowawaoo-ing]
Can't you see it's over?
Because you're the god of a shrinking universe.
 
Resuscitate
In my sleep
Awake to see
You're never here
But the losing yields
Another year
Facing hopes and fears
And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life
And the planes and trains
Are to blame
For tempting us
To refrain
And to cut the chord
Dis every word
Of the truths absurd
And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life
Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
And you've kissed my life
 
Hooohoooha yes please HAHA!
I cannot sleep
There's too much noise in my head*
I cannot sleep
I want it here instead*
I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna look at your face in peace now
You'll never miss
But I can
[Maniacal laughter]
I cannot keep
The shame that's clawed us out
I will not keep
Your shut-up, shut-up lies
I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna live in bliss, in peace now
You will never miss
But I can
[More maniacal laughter]
 
I'm sick of feeling my soul
To people who'll never know
Just how purposeless and empty they've grown
Because the language confuses
like computers refuse to understand how I'm feeling today
I'm freezing and losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
I'm freezing and losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
I saw a liquid control
That gives life to a soul
I hit my head on it and woke up to know
That I was all alone
Wearing just socks and a phone
Someone's screaming like their world might explode
Yeah I'm freezing and losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
I'm freezing and losing my way
I don't want another map of your head
Freezing and losing my way
I don't want another map of your head
I'm freezing and losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
 
Conforming on a monday
Too often and too cold
But you aren't even listening
Because you are just
Too old to feel an earthquake
Or too cool to even care
But you aren't even listening
So why should I?
You are
A natural disaster
And I've wanted you too much
And now I'm gonna lose
I've wanted you too much
And now I've gotta choose
You're the cause of all this
And I'm sick of trying to please you
And you're gonna feel my emotions coming
Because you're the world
Like a broken damn you're empty
And all that's left are the sticks and stones
That were built by other people
And it really shows
But you aren't even listening
Because you are just
Too old to feel an earthquake
Or too cool to even care
But you aren't even listening
So why should I?
You are
A natural disaster
And I've wanted you too much
And now I'm gonna lose
I've wanted you too much
And now I've gotta choose
You're the cause of all this
And I'm sick of trying to please you
And you're gonna feel my emotions coming
Because you're the world
 
Who-oo cares for the life we've earned?
Someone's saved all the truth you've earned
Remember when we used to shine?
And had no fear? Or sense of time?
(It creeps up on you)
You can't cry now
There's nothing to feel
No-one's noticed our loneliness
Remember when you used to tease?
And make us scream eternal joys
We believed that you'll always be here
'Cause once you promised a life with no fear
Please don't break my ideals
And say what's fake was always real
Hope was the one, now I'm gone
Take us back again.
 
I know there's something that you're dying to tell me
I hope it's not about your iffy affair
Make sure no-one finds out and tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself 'cause I can't bear it
I'd never leave you crying
I know you're crying
Doesn't matter 'cause I'm in control
I know that you're ashamed
So bad it nearly kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed
So much it almost kills you
There's always something that makes you guilty
There's still something that you're dying to tell me
Make sure no-one finds out
And tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself
'Cause I can't bear it
I'd never leave you crying
Oh, no you're crying
That doesn't matter 'cause I'm in control
I know that you're ashamed
So much it nearly kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed
So much it nearly kills you
 
Golden eyes
Feed my role
This forgotten space race
Under my control
Who's returned from the dead?
Who remains?
You wanted more than I was worth
You think I was scared, yeah
And you needed proof
Who really cares anymore?
Who restrains?
oooooommmmmmmowowow
ooooooooooo
I don't love you
I never did
I don't love you
I never will.
 
Shame on you for thinking
You're an exception
We're all to blame
Crashing down to earth
Wasting and burning out
Fading like a dead star
Harm is coming your way
It's coming your way
And you used to be everything to me
And now you're tired of fighting
Tired of fighting
Fighting yourself
Shame on you for thinking
You're all alone
If you want I'll make you wish you were
Failing to impress
Why can't you sleep with
Someone who'll protect you?
Harm is coming your way
It's coming your way
And you used to be everything to me
And now you're tired of fighting
Tired of fighting
Fighting yourself

Feel your pain

Ooooh ...
 
I'm hurting you again
Too lonely to pretend
Like everything is new
I promise you to
Blow it all away
In your world
No one is crying alone
In your world
No one is dying alone
Too broken to belong
too weak to sing along
I'll comfort you my friend
Helping you to
Blow it all away
In your world
No one is crying alone
In your world
No one is dying alone
 
She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time so
Look the other way
You will wait until it's over
To reveal what you'd never shown her
Too little much too late
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world
Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own
I have played in every toilet
But you still want to spoil it
To prove I've made a big mistake
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world
Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own
I'll do it on my own
 
You make me agitated,
You know i appreciate it
Why can't i complicate it
So why should i look at you
My love here is so true (very uncertain about that)
Yeah
You do it to me sweetly
Do them yeaahhh
You do it to me lovely
Do they yeaahhh
You try to make me crazy
You make me agitated
And then i'm suffocated
And why should i look at you
My love here is so true
You do it to me sweetly
Do them yeaahh
You do it to me lovely
Do they yeaahh
 
declare this an emergency
come on and spread a sense of urgency
and pull us through
and pull us through
and this is the end
this is the end of the world
it's time we saw a miracle
come on it's time for something biblical
to pull us through
and pull us through
and this is the end
this is the end of the world
proclaim eternal victory
come on and change the course of history
and pull us through
and pull us through
and this is the end 
this is the end of the world
 
I think I'm drowning
Asphyxiated
I wanna break this spell
That you've created
You're something beautiful
A contradiction
I wanna play the game
I want the friction
You will be the death of me
You will be the death of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
I wanted freedom
Bound and restricted
I tried to give you up
But I'm addicted
Now that you know I'm trapped sense of elation
You'd never dream of
Breaking this fixation
You will squeeze the life out of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
How did it come to this?
Oh
You will suck the life out of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
How did it come to this?
Oh
 
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful
Tiptoe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace
There's nowhere left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace
Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed
 
I won't stand in your way
Let your hatred grow
And she'll scream
And she'll shout
And she'll pray
And she had a name
Yeah she had a name
And I won't hold you back
Let your anger rise
And we'll fly
And we'll fall
And we'll burn
No one will recall
No one will recall
This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could
Look to the stars
Let hope burn in your eyes
And we'll love
And we'll hate
And we'll die
All to no avail
All to no avail
This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could
This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could
I wish I could
 
I can't remember when it was good
Moments of happiness elude
Maybe I just misunderstood
All of the love we left behind
Watching the flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
So I'll love whatever you become
And forget the reckless things we've done
I think our lives have just begun
I think our lives have just begun
And I'll feel my world crumbling
I'll feel my life crumbling
I'll feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away
Falling away with you
Staying awake to chase a dream
Tasting the air you're breathing in
I know I won't forget a thing
Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching the fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same
All of the love we threw away
All of the hopes we cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again
I can feel my world crumbling
I can feel my life crumbling
I can feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away
Falling away with you
All of the love we've left behind
Watching the flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
Memories I will never find
 
It's bugging me, grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out
'cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control
It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive
'cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control
And I want you now
I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode
 
Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself
This love's too good to last
And I'm too old to dream
Don't grow up too fast
And don't embrace the past
This life's too good to last
And i'm too young to care
Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself
This life could be the last
And we're too young to see
 
Change everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead
Best,
You've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now
Change everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead
Best,
You've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now
Don't let yourself down
Don't let yourself go
Your last chance has arrived
Best,
You've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now
 
Take, take all you need
And I'll compensate your greed
With broken hearts 
Sell, I'll sell your memories
For 15 pounds per year
But just the good days
Say, it'll make you insane
And it's bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
But I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm the priest God never paid
Hope, I hope you've seen the light
'Cause no one really cares
They're just pretending
Sell, I'll sell your memories
For 15 pounds per year
But you can keep the bad days
Say, it'll make you insane
And I'm bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
And I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm the priest God never paid 
Say, it'll make you insane
And I'm bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
And I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm the priest God never paid
 
There's a part of me you'll never know
The only thing I'll never show
Hopelessly I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
And I won't leave you falling
If the moment ever comes
It's plain to see it's trying to speak
Cherished dreams forever asleep
Hopelessly I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
And I won't leave you falling
If the moment ever comes
Hopelessly I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
And I won't leave you falling
But the moment never comes
 
Eerie whispers
trapped beneath my pillow
won't let me sleep
your memories
and I know you're in this room
I'm sure I heard you sigh
Floating in between
where our worlds collide
scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
and I know the moment's near
and there's nothing we can do
look through a faithless eye
are you afraid to die?
'cos it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
 
Repress and restrain
Steal the pressure and the pain
Wash the blood off your hands
This time she won't understand
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control 
You're working so hard
And you're never in charge
Your death creates success
Rebuild and suppress
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control 
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control
 
[Japanese Bonus Track]
You're so happy now
Burning a candle at both ends
Your self-loving soothes
And softens the blows you've invented
Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss
Crack's healing up
Future soul forgive this mess
You wait twenty years
And wind up alone, demented
Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss
Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss
 
Corrupt
You corrupt
And bring corruption to all that you touch
Hold
You'll behold
And beholden for all that you've done
Spell
Cast a spell
Cast a spell on the country you run
And risk
You will risk
You will risk all their lives and their souls
And burn
You will burn
You will burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell
You'll burn in hell
Yeah you'll burn in hell
For your sins
And our freedom's consuming itself
What we've become
It's contrary to what we want
Take a bow
Death
You bring death and destruction to all that you touch
Pay
You must pay
You must pay for your crimes against the earth
Yeah hex
Feed the hex
Feed the hex on the country you love
And beg

And burn
You will burn
You will burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell
You'll burn in hell
Yeah you'll burn in hell
You'll burn in hell
Yeah you'll burn in hell
For your sins
 
Far away
This ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die
Starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive
I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
Far away
This ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die
I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
I just wanted to hold
 
Oh baby don't you know I suffer
Oh baby can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
(Ooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the...
(Ooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive 
I thought I was a fool for no one
Ooh baby I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
And how long before you tell the truth
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive 
(You set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the...
(Ooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive 
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
(You set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the...
(Ooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
 
Fear and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I sow
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go
I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over
Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost
I want to touch the other side
And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see
That when we bleed we bleed the same
I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over
 
Throw it all away
Let's lose ourselves
'Cause there's no one left for us to blame
It's a shame we're all dying
And do you think you deserve your freedom
How could you send us so far away from home
When you know damn well that this is wrong
I would still lay down my life for you
And do you think you deserve your freedom
No I don't think you do
There's no justice in the world
There's no justice in the world
And there never was
 
Follow through
Make your dreams come true
Don't give up the fight
You will be alright
'Cause there's no one like you in the universe
Don't be afraid
What your mind conceives
You should make a stand
Stand up for what you believe
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible
During the struggle
They will pull us down
But please, please
Let's use this chance
To turn things around
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible
Do it on your own
It makes no difference to me
What you leave behind
What you choose to be
And whatever they say
Your soul's unbreakable
During the struggle
They will pull us down
But please, please
Let's use this chance
To turn things around
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible
Together we're invincible
During the struggle
They will pull us down
Please, please
Let's use this chance
To turn things around
And tonight
We can truly say
Together we're invincible
Together we're invincible
 
War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
Join forces underground
[Chorus:]
Lose control
Increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
Time to erase 
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born
Aim, shoot, kill your leaders
Oppose and disagree
Destroy demonocracy
[Chorus:]
Lose control
Increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
Time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born
 
Open the skies over me
I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for a sign
As conspiracies unwind
Will you slam shut
Or free your mind
Or stay hypnotized
When the Zetas fill the skies
Will our leaders tell us why
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds
I am waited patiently
I'll wait for the sign
Carried through the centuries
Secrets locked up
And loaded on my back
And it weighs me down
When the Zetas fill the skies
It's just our leaders in disguise
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds
I am waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign, yeah
And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign
 
Stay away from me
Build a fortress
And shield your beliefs
Touch the divine
As we fall in line
Can I believe
When I don't trust
All your theories
Turn to dust
I choose to hide
From the all seeing eye
Destroy this City of Delusion
Break these walls down
I will avenge
Justify my reasons
With your blood
You'll not rest
Settle for less
Until you guzzle
And squander what's left
Do not deny
That you live and let die
Destroy this City of Delusion
Break these walls down
I will avenge
Justify my reasons
With your blood
Destroy this City of Delusion
Break these walls down
I will avenge
Justify my reasons
With your blood
 
Come into my life
Regress into a dream
We will hide
And build a new reality
Draw another picture
Of the life you could've had
Follow your instincts
And choose the other path
You should never be afraid
You're protected from trouble and pain
Why, why is this a crisis in your eyes again
Come to be
How did it come to be
Tied to a railroad
No love to set us free
Watch our souls fade away
And our bodies crumble away
Don't be afraid
I will take the blow for you
I have had recurring nightmares
That I was loved for who I am
And missed the opportunity
To be a better man
 
Come ride with me
Through the veins of history
I'll show you a god who
Falls asleep on the job
And how can we win
When fools can be kings
Don't waste your time
Or time will waste you
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
 
Rose-tinted view
And satellites that compromise the truth
I wanted more
With the cuts and the bruises
Touch my face
A hopeless embrace
Faith, it drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a strangers love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies, it feeds the curse
We, too, could be glorious
I need to believe
But I still want more
With the cuts and the bruises
Don't close the door
On what you adore
Faith, it drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a strangers love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies, it feeds the curse
We, too, could be glorious
 
Paranoia is in bloom,
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(so come on)
Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(so come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(so come on)
Interchanging mind control
Come, let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(so come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(so come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(so come on)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(so come on)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
 
Is our secret safe tonight
And are we out of sight
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place
Is this our last embrace
Or will the walls start caving in?
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it should have been right
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) To let our hearts ignite
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole?
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) This is out of control
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) It could never last
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Must erase it fast
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it could have been right
(It could be wrong, could be...)
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed
If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it should have been right
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) To let our hearts ignite
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole?
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) This is out of control
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) It could never last
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Must erase it fast
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it could have been right
(It could be wrong, could be...)
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed
The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
It's time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm
Resistance

Wake to see
Your true emancipation is a fantasy
Policies
Have risen up and overcome the brave

Greatness dies
Unsung and lost, invisible to history
Embedded spies
Brainwashing our children to be mean

You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy

Your supremacy

You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy

Your supremacy
Supremacy

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve
I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you mean
Oh oh oh

And now, I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
Like some kind of madness
Was taking control
Yeah

And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you need
Mm

And now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care)
But I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light)
I have finally realized (Realized)
I need to love
I need to love

Come to me,
Trust in your dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I have known, I can be wrong
Maybe I'm too headstrong
Our love is
Madness

You won't get much closer
Till you sacrifice it all (all)
You won't get to taste it
With your face against the wall (wall wall)
Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within (in in)
Do just what you want to
And now stand up and begin

Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station

Doubts will try to break you
Unleash your heart and soul
Trouble will surround you
Start taking some control
Stand up and deliver
Your wildest fantasy
Do what the fuck you want to
There's no one to appease

Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station

Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
And I know that you will fight for the duration

Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And I know I'm not resisting the temptations
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at Panic Station

Once I hoped
To seek the new and unknown
This planet's overrun
There's nothing left for you or for me
Don't give in, we can
Walk through the fields
And feeling nature's glow
But all the land is owned
There's none left for you or for me

Who will win?
'Cause I concede

Free me
Free me
Free me from this world
I don't belong here
It was a mistake imprisoning my soul
Can you free me
Free me from this world

A world lush and blue
With rivers running wild
They'll be re-routed South
With none left for you or for me
Don't give in
Hear the engines roar
And save our crops from drought
But when the black gold's in doubt
There's none left for you or for me
Fusing helium-3, our last hope

And free me
And free me
Free me from this world
We don't belong here
It was a mistake imprisoning our souls
Can you free me
Free me from this world

Free me
I'll free you
Free us from this world
We don't belong here
It was a mistake imprisoning our souls
Can you free me
Free me from this world

Running around in circles feeling caged by endless rules
Can you free me, free me from this world

Go to sleep

Healed, or are you still just reeling?
Are you fine? Have you found
A way to escape?
Are you there, just because I need you?
Can we hole up, a big freeze
Is headind our way?

We are on a hiding to nowhere
We still hope, but our dreams
Are not the same
And I, I lost before I started
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay

Fight, or will you show me mercy?
We've expelled, the goodness
From our hearts
Are you here, just to prove you're winning?
Can we hole up, and ride out this electrical storm?

We destroyed something beautiful
We have faith, but our truths
Are not the same
Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
Stop the loneliest force becoming
King of the universe

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't you let the sun in your heat decay

Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
I won't let the sun in your heart decay

Save me from my superstitions
Now I'm free from this soul's condition
Wait just a while
And I'll greet you with a smile
Hold me 'cause I'm sure I'm hated
Promises they are overrated
Wait just a while
While I'm drowning in denial

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need your rescue
Watch me 'cause I'm on a mission
Hold me back so I'm forced to listen
Don't let me go 'cause I'm nothing without you

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need you rescue

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need your rescue

Take me for a ride
Break me up and steal what's left inside
And make them pray
The iniquity has died inside and left a scar

I'm all red and done
Bring me peace and wash away my dirt
Spin me round and have me to divert
And walk into the light

Warm my heart to remind
And hold my head up high
And help me to survive
Kick me when I'm down

Feed me poison, for me till I drown
Wake me up before I get ṗunched out
And fall into the night

All natural and technological processes
Proceed in such a way that the availability
Of the remaining energy decreases
In all energy exchanges, if no energy
Enters or leaves an isolated system
The entropy of that system increases
Energy continuously flows from being
Concentrated to becoming dispersed
Spread out, wasted and useless
New energy cannot be created and high grade
Energy is being destroyed
An economy based on endless growth is
Unsustainable

The fundamental laws of thermodynamics will
Place fixed limits on technological innovation
And human advancement
In an isolated system, the entropy
Can only increase
A species set on endless growth is
Unsustainable

Dead inside!
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
Confine me then erase me babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like it died long ago

Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside!

You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverized
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft

Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside!

Feel me now, hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me, stop hiding from me
It's hurting babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything
I can't give you anymore
Now I've become just like you

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside!

Love, it will get you nowhere
You are on your own
Lost in the wild
So come to me now
I could use someone like you
Someone who'll kill on my command
And asks no questions

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

Are you a human drone?
(Aye, sir!)
Are you a killing machine?
(Aye, sir!)
I'm in control, motherfucker, do you understand?
(Aye, sir!)

Your mind is just a program
And I'm the virus
I'm changing the station
I'll improve your thresholds
I'll turn you into a super drone (super drone)
And you will kill on my command
And I won't be responsible

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

Are you a psycho killer? Say "I'm a psycho killer!"
(I am a psycho killer!)
Scream it!
(I am a psycho killer!)
Show me your war face!
(Ah!)
You are a pussy! I said show me your war face!
(Ah!)

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

Your ass belongs to me now
Your ass belongs to me now

Help me, I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game
I tried to infiltrate, but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the
Ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul

Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have
To bring me down
Running from the
Ghosts and shadows the world just disavows

Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please

Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul

Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

Home, It's becoming a killing field
There's a cross hair locked on my heart
With no recourse and there's no one behind the wheel
Hell fire, You're wiping me out, killed by

Drones, (killed by)
Drones (killed by)

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
'Cause you've got the CIA, babe
But all you've done is brutalise
Drones!

War, war just moved up a gear
I don't think I can handle the truth
I'm just a pawn
And we're all expendable
Incidentally
Electronically erased
By your

Drones, (killed by)
Drones (killed by)

You kill by remote control
The world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
Now I am radicalized
Drones!

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
'Cause you've got the CIA, babe
But all you've done is brutalise

You kill by remote control
The world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
Now I am radicalized
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!

You were my oppressor
And I, I have been programmed to obey
But now, you are my handler
And I, I will execute your demands

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

Behold my transformation
And you are empowered to do as you please
My mind was lost in translation
And my heart has become a cold and impassive machine

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

How did we get in so much trouble?
Getting out just seems impossible
Oppression is persisting
I can't fight this brain conditioning

Our freedom's just a loan
Run by machines and drones
They've got us locked into their sights
Soon they'll control what's left inside

Don't try to hide it, don't tell me it's not there

You've got strength
You've got soul
You've felt pain
You've felt love
You can grow (you can grow)
You can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

Can you hear a distant thunder
Taste earth's blood and hunger
We live in a toxic jungle
Truth is suppressed to mumbles

They'll take away our homes
They're just machines and drones

Don't try to fight it, don't tell me you can't see

That you've got strength
You've got soul
You've felt pain
You've felt love
You can grow (you can grow)
You can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

I can fell your pain
I can feel your confusion
I can see you're trapped in a maze
Let's find a way to escape

You've got strength
You've got soul
You're not afraid
You're not a drone
You can grow (you can grow)
You can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem

Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

You think you're strong and you can't be broken
But your empire is dissolving
You thought, you thought I was weak
But you got it wrong
Look into my eyes
I'm a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

Your blood is blue and your mind's turned green
And your belly is all yellow
You believe your throne is too high to be overthrown
We'll watch it get razed
By a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

I'm a defector
Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

We look for strength and assistance
Confident that with your help
Man will be what he was born to be
Free and independent

War is all around
I'm growing tired to fighting
I've been drained and I can't hide it
But I have strength for you, you're all that's real anymore
I am coming home now, I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

States are crumbling, and walls are rising high again
It's no place for the faint hearted
But my heart is strong 'cause now I know where I belong
It's you and I against the world
And we are free

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

We've gone against the tide
All we have is each other now
I am coming home now
I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

You were never truly loved
You've only been betrayed
You were never truly nurtured
By churches or the state
You left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands
That you could rise up like a god
Arm yourself, you can be strong
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire
Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy
Now you finally have good
I have given you good

There's no country left
To love and cherish it's bond
It's gone for good
It's here and maybe
Survivors
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were
There are no countries left
To fight and conquer
I think I destroyed them all
It's human nature
The greatest
Until we'll survive alone
With no one left to love

There's no country left
To love and cherish, it's gone
You know it's gone for good
A trillion memories last in
Space and time forever more
I just wanted, I just needed to be loved
